    "Over the past few years, streaming services with huge catalogues have become the primary means through which most people listen to their favourite music. But at the same time, the sheer amount of music on offer can mean users might be a bit overwhelmed when trying to look for newer music that suits their tastes.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this reason, streaming services have looked into means of categorizing music to allow for personalized recommendations. One method involves direct analysis of the raw audio information in a given song, scoring the raw data on a variety of metrics. Today, we'll be examining data compiled by a research group known as The Echo Nest. Our goal is to look through this dataset and classify songs as being either 'Hip-Hop' or 'Rock' - all without listening to a single one ourselves. In doing so, we will learn how to clean our data, do some exploratory data visualization, and use feature reduction towards the goal of feeding our data through some simple machine learning algorithms, such as decision trees and logistic regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin with, let's load the metadata about our tracks alongside the track metrics compiled by The Echo Nest. A song is about more than its title, artist, and number of listens. We have another dataset that has musical features of each track such as `danceability` and `acousticness` on a scale from -1 to 1. These exist in two different files, which are in different formats - csv and json. While csv is a popular file format for denoting tabular data, json is another common file format in which databases often return the results of a given query.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by creating two pandas `DataFrames` out of these files that we can merge so we have labels and features for the classification later on."

    "Success! Balancing our data has removed bias towards the more prevalent class. To get a good sense of how well our models are actually performing, we can apply what's called **cross-validation** (CV). This step allows us to compare models in a more rigorous fashion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the way our data is split into train and test sets can impact model performance, CV attempts to split the data multiple ways and test the model on each of the splits. Although there are many different CV methods, all with their own advantages and disadvantages, we will use what's known as **K-fold** CV here. K-fold first splits the data in K different, equally sized subsets. Then, it iteratively uses each subset as a test set while using the remainder of the data as train sets. Finally, we can then aggregate the results from each fold for a final model performance score."
